Make a ball follow a path using computer vision

### Questions:
1. Is all computer vision the manipulation of matrices?
2. Is there a good way to find the limit of data compression when using computer vision? 
3. If there is a good way to find the limit of data compression is there a general method or is it always specific to the application?
